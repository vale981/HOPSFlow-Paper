* Outline
** Intro
- significance of quantum thermo
- prior art
- overview of our method and its capabilities/advantages
- short intro into our example application

*** TODO Find out which papers to cite
- from my thesis
- from konstantins
- new stuff from cyril?

** Energy Flow with HOPS
- short intro about structure of section

*** NMQSD
- very brief
- mostly cite other papers

*** HOPS
- same: brief and cite
- introduce notation

*** Energy Flow
- demonstrate one bath/linear in detail
- finite temperature too

*** Generalizations
- list and explain expressions: nonlinear, finite temp, general observables
- refer to appendix for details?

** Application
- short outline of applications
- mention the analytic verification and refer to thesis?

*** One Bath: Energy Transfer Tuning
- simplest case: one bath, zero T

*** Two Bath
- otto motor setup
- cite papers that looked at it

**** Simple: Continously Coupled vs Modulated Coupling

**** TODO verify what has been done
- carnot eficiency
- efficiency vs power heatmap?

**** TODO scan timing
- compression and expansion timing variation in less markovian regime
- likely: no advantage

** Conclusion
- brief review of what has been achieved
- bath sections
- other bath observables accessible through tricks?
- other finite temp method... -> advantage: probably no derivatives of
  stochastic processes, but more hierarchy depth

* Tasks
** TODO Merge HOPS
- time dependent coupling
- online calc
- tests
- docs

** TODO sort out richards libraries
